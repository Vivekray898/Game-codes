# Simple Games in Go

Welcome to the **Simple Games in Go** repository! ðŸŽ® This project contains basic games written in Go (Golang) to demonstrate the power of Go for building interactive console applications. Whether you're learning Go or just looking for some fun coding exercises, these games are a great starting point!

## Games Included

### 1. Number Guessing Game
A fun game where the computer generates a random number, and you have to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

**How to Play:**
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- You have 7 attempts to guess the number.
- Hints like "Too high!" or "Too low!" will help you find the correct answer.
